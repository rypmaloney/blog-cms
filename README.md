# Blog CMS 

This is a basic CMS backend for the blog API. I feel my skill for writing has been atrophying (I haven't written much since I graduated college in 2016 with a degree in English Lit), so hopefully this will give me the means and motive to use that part of my brain. 


This project is broken in to three parts.
1. **The API** - [repository](https://github.com/rypmaloney/blog-api-backend)  There are two main routes dealt with here. /admin/ which coveres requests sent from the CMS I've made, and /api/ which covers requests from the blog front end. 
2. **The CMS** - [live preview](https://rypmaloney.github.io/blog-cms/) - sends requests to the /admin/ routes of the API. All POST/DELETE/UPDATE routes are protected with a JWT.
3. **The Portfolio** - [repository](https://github.com/rypmaloney/portfolio) -  Once completed, this project will send GET requests to the /api/ routes.
